# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the implementation of free map alternatives to replace Google Maps API in the RideLink cab-sharing application. The goal is to provide mapping, geocoding, and routing functionality without the cost and usage limitations of Google Maps API, while maintaining a good user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a ride creator, I want to search for and select pickup and destination locations using free map services, so that I can create rides without incurring Google Maps API costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the location picker THEN the system SHALL display an interactive map using OpenStreetMap tiles
2. WHEN a user searches for a location THEN the system SHALL use Nominatim geocoding API to find matching places
3. WHEN a user taps on the map THEN the system SHALL reverse geocode the coordinates to show the address
4. WHEN a user selects a location THEN the system SHALL return the coordinates and formatted address
5. IF the primary geocoding service fails THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a ride participant, I want to see the route between pickup and destination on a map, so that I can understand the journey before joining a ride.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing ride details THEN the system SHALL display a map with pickup and destination markers
2. WHEN route calculation is requested THEN the system SHALL use OpenRouteService API to get directions
3. WHEN route is calculated THEN the system SHALL display the route polyline on the map
4. WHEN route calculation succeeds THEN the system SHALL show distance, estimated duration, and fare
5. IF route calculation fails THEN the system SHALL show pickup and destination markers without route line

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline for basic map viewing, so that I can still see ride locations when I have poor internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is offline THEN the system SHALL display cached map tiles if available
2. WHEN viewing previously loaded locations THEN the system SHALL show markers from cached data
3. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL disable search functionality and show appropriate messaging
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically enable search and routing features
5. WHEN map tiles are loaded THEN the system SHALL cache them for offline viewing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a fallback system for map services, so that the app remains functional if the primary free services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN primary geocoding service fails THEN the system SHALL attempt backup geocoding service
2. WHEN primary routing service fails THEN the system SHALL attempt backup routing service
3. WHEN all free services fail THEN the system SHALL provide basic functionality with manual coordinate entry
4. WHEN service failures occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for monitoring
5. WHEN services recover THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an app administrator, I want to monitor the usage of free map services, so that I can ensure we stay within rate limits and plan for scaling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track request counts and response times
2. WHEN rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement request throttling
3. WHEN daily limits are reached THEN the system SHALL switch to backup services or show appropriate messaging
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
5. WHEN usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL provide analytics for service optimization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the map interface to be responsive and user-friendly, so that I can easily interact with locations despite using free services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map loads THEN it SHALL display within 3 seconds on average
2. WHEN searching for locations THEN results SHALL appear within 2 seconds
3. WHEN calculating routes THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
4. WHEN map interactions occur THEN they SHALL respond immediately with visual feedback
5. IF services are slow THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
